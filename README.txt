The work contained in this repository is part of the research being done by Steven Kitzes in his thesis work, a comparative performance study of Node.js and Apache/PHP.  Included are some test scripts (scripts for execution by the web application engines themselves, found in the 'test-scripts' directory), tools (helper scripts to be used in conjunction with the test scripts mentioned above and ease large-scale testing; found in the 'tools' directory), and some test results (found in the 'results' directory; note that not all results are retained or pushed to the repository to cut down on clutter).  Each directory in this repository contains a 'documentation.txt' file providing descriptions and usage guides for the content therein; with the exception of the 'results' directory, which contains only one script, whose documentation is contained in comments within the script itself.
