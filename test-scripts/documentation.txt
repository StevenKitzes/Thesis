The scripts contained in this folder are the scripts that are intended to be run by the actual web servers themselves (i.e. Node.js and Apache/PHP).  They are kept in this central directory for easy maintenance on our GitHub repository, but need to be copied into your local DocumentRoot (Apache) or /routes/ directory (Node) in order to be used.  Then, you can use a browser to verify the scripts are working as expected, and Apache Bench to run large-scale concurrency and load tests.
